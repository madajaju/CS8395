## CS 8395 – Scalable Microservices

**Instructor:** Dr. Darren Pulsipher  
**Meeting Time:** Thursdays, 5:00–6:15 PM CT (Online via Zoom)  
**Office Hours:** Thursdays, 6:15–7:00 PM CT  
**Semester:** Spring 2026

---

## Course Description

This course explores the **architecture, patterns, and implementation techniques** used to build  
**scalable, secure, and resilient microservices**.

The course is **architecture-first**:

> We study the pattern — then explore how it’s implemented across languages.

Frameworks are presented as *realizations* of architectural concepts, with examples from:

- **Java** (Spring Boot, Project Reactor)
- **Node.js** (Express, NestJS, RxJS)
- **Python** (FastAPI, asyncio)
- **Go** (Gin, net/http, goroutines)

Reactive programming is taught as an **architectural style**, not just a framework feature.

Students learn through discussions, hands-on labs, comparative implementations, and a polyglot capstone project.

---

## Instructor Philosophy

Modern engineers must design, reason, communicate, and adapt.

This course simulates professional practice:

- architect systems,
- justify design choices,
- iterate based on feedback,
- collaborate effectively,
- and responsibly leverage Generative AI as a thinking partner — not a substitute for understanding.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Architect scalable, resilient microservice systems using proven design patterns.
2. Evaluate synchronous vs asynchronous communication approaches.
3. Apply authentication and authorization strategies (OAuth2, OIDC, JWT).
4. Understand and implement reactive and event-driven programming paradigms.
5. Compare language and framework trade-offs for real-world systems.
6. Identify coupling, reliability risks, and scaling constraints.
7. Use Generative AI responsibly to support design, development, and debugging.

## Course Structure

**Before Class**
- Review short lectures and provided resources.

**During Class**
- 10–15 minute **architecture mini-lecture**
- Pattern-driven discussions
- Guided hands-on labs
- Case-study evaluations

**After Class**
- Complete assignments
- Reflect & iterate using feedback
- Use office hours for deeper technical dives

---

## Required Tools & Resources

- **Brightspace** — syllabus, links, announcements
- **GitHub** — course examples & assignment templates
- **Docker** and **Git**
- Ability to run at least **two** of the following stacks:

    - Java / Spring Boot
    - Node.js / Express or NestJS
    - Python / FastAPI
    - Go / Gin

- Generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)

> You choose your primary implementation language — but you will compare across at least two.

---

## Use of Generative AI

GenAI is encouraged for:

- brainstorming architectures
- debugging
- generating boilerplate
- explaining unfamiliar concepts
- creating test cases

**Rules**

1. **Verify** everything — AI can be confidently wrong.
2. **Disclose clearly** where and how AI was used.
3. You must **fully understand** all submitted work.
4. Save/submit AI conversations when requested.

Failure to disclose AI use may be treated as an integrity violation.

## Grading

| Component | Weight |
|----------:|-------:|
| Assignments (A0–A3) | 40% |
| Final Project (A4) | 25% |
| Final Exam – Interview | 20% |
| Weekly Participation | 10% |
| Midterm Exam | 5% |

Assignments are graded based on the comprehensive rubrics located in the `doc/assignments` folder. There are no preliminary submissions; ensure your final repository is complete by the Sunday deadline.

---

## Participation Policy

- Deadlines are **firm** — late work is not accepted.
- Content builds sequentially; missing work compounds difficulty.
- Participation in labs/discussion is expected.
