00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.099
Darren Pulsipher: Good afternoon, good evening. How's everyone doing today?

2
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.339
Tricia Brown: Hello, how are you?

3
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.990
Eric Farber-Eger: O?

4
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.890
Martina Nikic: Good, how are you?

5
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.830
Darren Pulsipher: I see some old, familiar faces!

6
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.839
Darren Pulsipher: And some new ones!

7
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.170
Darren Pulsipher: I do like to see people's faces, just so you guys know. We'll do cameras on on these sessions on Thursdays.

8
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.170
Darren Pulsipher: Which we'll go over a little bit today.

9
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:38.200
Darren Pulsipher: We'll give a couple more minutes, because I do believe there's 8… 8 to 10 people.

10
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.159
Darren Pulsipher: Scheduled.

11
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.759
Darren Pulsipher: Let me double check real quick.

12
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.210
Darren Pulsipher: Alright.

13
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.709
Darren Pulsipher: More people are joining. All right, well, then, come on.

14
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.209
Darren Pulsipher: Philip, I recognize.

15
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:16.670
Darren Pulsipher: How was everyone's Christmas, and New Year's break.

16
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.680
Darren Pulsipher: Hopefully people got some time off.

17
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.449
Eric Farber-Eger: Oh yeah, it was good. Lots of chasing the kids around.

18
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.400
Darren Pulsipher: That's always fun.

19
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.610
Darren Pulsipher: I spend my time chasing my kids out. They are gone.

20
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.889
Darren Pulsipher: My wife and I are finally empty nesters, so it's kind of nice.

21
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.740
Darren Pulsipher: So, let's see, I just logged in, let's see…

22
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:52.130
Darren Pulsipher: how many other people we have. Well, you guys obviously were able to see the bright,

23
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.340
Darren Pulsipher: Was it called Brightspace?

24
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.610
Darren Pulsipher: Alright.

25
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:07.670
Darren Pulsipher: Let's see… To nail… Okay.

26
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.560
Darren Pulsipher: We should, we're expecting a couple more people, and then we'll get kicked off.

27
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.030
Darren Pulsipher: Wait, Tom has joined twice. Okay. That helps.

28
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.520
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): Yeah, that's…

29
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.150
Darren Pulsipher: Thank God.

30
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:29.690
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): just adds to the count. But the, yeah, sorry, I just… I have my cell phone on one, and one of the, the big screen on the other.

31
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:30.319
Darren Pulsipher: No, no problem.

32
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.029
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): But the cell phone for the video.

33
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:43.749
Darren Pulsipher: Well, we'll go ahead and get started, now that we're a couple minutes after. Let me introduce myself real quick. I'm Dr. Darren Pulsifer.

34
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:50.920
Darren Pulsipher: You can just call me, Darren or Dr. Darren. No one can ever get my name right all the time.

35
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.440
Darren Pulsipher: On my last name.

36
00:08:52.830 --> 00:09:00.239
Darren Pulsipher: I've been teaching for… at Vanderbilt for over a year now. I taught this class before.

37
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.160
Darren Pulsipher: But I completely revamped it.

38
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.170
Darren Pulsipher: because of, a philosophy that I'm kind of taking

39
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.450
Darren Pulsipher: And we had quite a bit of success with, with some adjustments, which,

40
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:30.849
Darren Pulsipher: the people that had my class last semester, you're gonna see some of the adjustments this semester to make, to make things better. And I think one of the reasons why we… I've changed things so, so much is because of, technology changes in the world around generative AI, specifically.

41
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:37.250
Darren Pulsipher: And my goal that I have for you guys is that

42
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:42.340
Darren Pulsipher: First off, when you're done with this, that you can get jobs, because that's important.

43
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:47.180
Darren Pulsipher: Right? Because I know, I've, I've got, 10 kids.

44
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:52.450
Darren Pulsipher: So I know what it means to support family and to support yourselves.

45
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:58.230
Darren Pulsipher: And with the… with everything that's going on, especially around computer science and…

46
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:07.899
Darren Pulsipher: and software engineering, I think it's important that we up our game. So you're going to find in this class, we're going to up our game quite a bit, and start thinking at a much higher level.

47
00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:26.889
Darren Pulsipher: then I'm not going to be concerned about code as much as I am design patterns in architecture, and making sure that you guys make architectural decisions that are wise, instead of just being able to regurgitate an API from a language.

48
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:34.210
Darren Pulsipher: And the reason I think the big shift is because I can have generative AI do that for me all day long.

49
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.860
Darren Pulsipher: That's… that's what they're good at, is regurgitation.

50
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.530
Darren Pulsipher: So I'm gonna try and up… up your game, basically.

51
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:51.329
Darren Pulsipher: This course is microservice… scalable microservice architectures, and we're going to add some resilience and security in there as well.

52
00:10:51.440 --> 00:11:03.990
Darren Pulsipher: In the past, this class has been taught by some incredible, incredible computer scientists that have written books and published papers and contributed to the Java Spring Framework.

53
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.660
Darren Pulsipher: We're not covering JavaSpring this time. If you want to, you can.

54
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:19.850
Darren Pulsipher: Instead, we're going to talk about the design patterns and architectural decisions. It will be a multi-language course. We'll be working in

55
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:28.869
Darren Pulsipher: whatever languages you want, frankly, as long as it can, handle the design patterns. There will be some.

56
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:45.249
Darren Pulsipher: what's the right word? There will be some, wise ways to choose things. In my last class, we had a student that decided to make his life so much harder than it had to be, and those that are in the class know exactly who I'm talking about.

57
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:50.079
Darren Pulsipher: He learned a lot. He learned an awful lot.

58
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.570
Darren Pulsipher: But he made his job a lot harder, so I suggest…

59
00:11:54.770 --> 00:12:11.819
Darren Pulsipher: looking at best practices and guidance in the lectures, they will help you make wise decisions in what you decide to do. This may be uncomfortable for some of you guys, because you're going to be used… some of your courses that you've had in the past

60
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:20.739
Darren Pulsipher: You're used to code already written for you, and frameworks already set up for you, and test cases you need to pass. You're not getting any of that from me.

61
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:21.910
Darren Pulsipher: None.

62
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:30.090
Darren Pulsipher: It… because that… in fact, I took the course… I took this exact course.

63
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:44.209
Darren Pulsipher: Over the summer, and I took the final assignment, and I pumped it into Juni, which is a, a Gen AI on steroids with IntelliJ, and it finished the whole course.

64
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.799
Darren Pulsipher: All the assignments in 10 minutes.

65
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:49.970
Darren Pulsipher: pass 100%.

66
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.829
Darren Pulsipher: And I said, you know what?

67
00:12:53.980 --> 00:13:03.069
Darren Pulsipher: I'm not gonna… I'm not gonna do that to you guys, because I think, that would be… if I… if I just gave you the same assignment, that would be a detriment to you.

68
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:08.419
Darren Pulsipher: And… I just don't think that's worth your time and your effort.

69
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:25.119
Darren Pulsipher: To be able to regurgitate what a Gen AI can do for you. So we're going to focus a lot on architectural decisions in Gen AI, and you'll see that in the courses. And Eric and Tricia and Philip have had my course, not this course, but

70
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.880
Darren Pulsipher: Last semester, so they know, kind of, the approach that I'm gonna take.

71
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:34.239
Darren Pulsipher: So, any questions on that, so far, from you guys?

72
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:37.560
Darren Pulsipher: Nope.

73
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:45.479
Darren Pulsipher: Okay, I… I do… I do have a slide presentation I will show. Oh, actually… I normally… Oh, go ahead, Philip.

74
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:51.160
Philip Eykamp: Actually, I do have a question, perhaps slightly in jest, but not totally.

75
00:13:51.470 --> 00:14:04.939
Philip Eykamp: I would love to hear again, because I think you discussed this last term, how you would differentiate between what you're teaching us and vibe coding, just because that term has become a scourge on our industry.

76
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:15.899
Darren Pulsipher: Yeah, so I'm gonna teach you… I'm gonna teach you how to direct a Gen AI to help you make wise architecture decisions. The code?

77
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.090
Darren Pulsipher: is secondary.

78
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.870
Darren Pulsipher: And one of the reasons why I say that is I truly believe

79
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:30.289
Darren Pulsipher: That in the next 5 years, maybe? Maybe less than that.

80
00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:36.439
Darren Pulsipher: there, that GenAI will start, generating machine code directly.

81
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.689
Darren Pulsipher: Or a different kind of code that's not human readable.

82
00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:46.130
Darren Pulsipher: But that is machine readable, that can go to machine code.

83
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.440
Darren Pulsipher: And talk at the… at the microcode level.

84
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:55.300
Darren Pulsipher: I, I truly believe that, that could, that could happen.

85
00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:01.519
Darren Pulsipher: So… No, no problem, you go by Tom or Thomas?

86
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.990
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): Sorry, mute button. I go by Tom.

87
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:23.109
Darren Pulsipher: All right, so Tom, I'll dive right in, so you know what's on track, and then we can have a discussion after that, because I don't want you to miss, kind of the meat of what we have planned today. So let me share my screen here. Does that answer your question, Philip?

88
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.899
Philip Eykamp: Yes, thank you.

89
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:28.970
Darren Pulsipher: All right.

90
00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:34.840
Darren Pulsipher: Philip will always, challenge me, which is exactly what I want to hear.

91
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.820
Darren Pulsipher: So… Alright,

92
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:53.519
Darren Pulsipher: So, we'll talk about course philosophy, the course contents, the structure of the lecture material, which you guys will get used to, and then the assignments, and we'll talk about grading, and how to set up your dev environment, and all that.

93
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:57.540
Darren Pulsipher: Course philosophy. This one is really important.

94
00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:05.609
Darren Pulsipher: I don't see you guys as coders. I see you as not even software developers. I see you more as software

95
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:11.530
Darren Pulsipher: engineers and architects, and I'm going to treat you as such. You guys are all master's students.

96
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:24.200
Darren Pulsipher: So, we're gonna think at a lot, higher level than, just script monkeys, right? If you want to learn a language, you're free to do that on your own time.

97
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.649
Darren Pulsipher: Right? Let's just put it that way.

98
00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:41.649
Darren Pulsipher: Okay? And you will be learning a lot of new techniques, and maybe even a new language during this course. We are going to learn how to write concurrent and massively parallel microservice architectures.

99
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:51.860
Darren Pulsipher: It will require, I am gonna… I am gonna have you guys using Docker, which we'll talk about, but you do not need a cloud environment.

100
00:16:51.860 --> 00:17:07.749
Darren Pulsipher: to do this. You can run all this stuff on your desktops or laptops. If you want to run it in a cloud and go hogwell crazy, you're more than welcome to do that as well, because we're going to focus on the different design patterns and architectures throughout this course.

101
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:08.930
Darren Pulsipher: Okay.

102
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.849
Darren Pulsipher: One of the reasons why

103
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:24.940
Darren Pulsipher: And this is really easy. Just so you guys know, I work at Intel Corporation. That's my full-time job. This I'm doing because…

104
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:35.289
Darren Pulsipher: I enjoy teaching. And one thing I want to get across to you guys is, even though we're in a part of, technology right now that's moving so rapidly.

105
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:43.599
Darren Pulsipher: We've seen these before, and there have been several times that… and I don't know if you guys know Moore's Law.

106
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:52.099
Darren Pulsipher: But Moore's Law basically says that every two years, the number of transistors doubles in the same amount of space. That's Moore's Law.

107
00:17:52.480 --> 00:18:00.550
Darren Pulsipher: the ramifications of Moore's Law, says that speed doubles every two years, which…

108
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:08.649
Darren Pulsipher: in the long term has really happened. We've been told several times by industry leaders,

109
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.869
Darren Pulsipher: that, Moore's Law is dead.

110
00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:23.770
Darren Pulsipher: And anytime someone says that, there's a major breakthrough. And one, and the reason I bring this up is because this shows you how rapidly things are growing.

111
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:41.390
Darren Pulsipher: And because they're growing so rapidly, we, as software architects and software engineers, need to understand, that kind of growth so that we can architect systems that can last beyond a year and a half or two years.

112
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:57.059
Darren Pulsipher: Right? So, understanding that technology is going to advance even beyond, some of our architectures, or some of our coding that we've done, our architectures still need to be sound and solid moving forward.

113
00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:02.480
Darren Pulsipher: Some of the best examples of that, there is an organization

114
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:10.330
Darren Pulsipher: there… there's an organization out there, called… oh, let's see if I get it right… DCMA?

115
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:17.470
Darren Pulsipher: They are in charge of all the defense contracts for the United States Department of War.

116
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.629
Darren Pulsipher: Right? All of them.

117
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:26.030
Darren Pulsipher: The software is the oldest piece of software running in the world today. It's written in COBOL,

118
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.239
Darren Pulsipher: And it is running on a mainframe.

119
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.509
Darren Pulsipher: And it is almost 60 years old.

120
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.310
Darren Pulsipher: So that architecture has…

121
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:44.489
Darren Pulsipher: withstood all this change. They've tried several times to, to migrate it off of the mainframe onto something more modern.

122
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:55.959
Darren Pulsipher: And this is where things fell apart, because the core foundation of that architecture is solid, but they built a spaghetti mess around it, and they can't move it without destroying everything.

123
00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:05.300
Darren Pulsipher: So, we want to make sure that we're architecting things that can be extended easily, but also migrated as well. So we're going to work on those types of architectures.

124
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.019
Darren Pulsipher: Okay? That's why I bring up Moore's Law.

125
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.809
Darren Pulsipher: Let's go to the next slide here.

126
00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.039
Darren Pulsipher: Oh, and I forgot to hit the record button. No, it's already recording, right?

127
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.000
Darren Pulsipher: I think I already set it up.

128
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.810
Eric Farber-Eger: Yeah, it says recording on my side.

129
00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:30.639
Darren Pulsipher: Okay, thank you, thank you. One thing I want to make sure that… that we, look at in…

130
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:45.740
Darren Pulsipher: in this course, is we're going to be doing a lot of things, but we're also going to be discussing a lot of things, because I see there's a lot of real value in our Thursday calls as these not being just Darren lecturing.

131
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.000
Darren Pulsipher: But us discussing.

132
00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:54.340
Darren Pulsipher: And, one change that we're going to make this semester over last semester

133
00:20:54.550 --> 00:21:04.639
Darren Pulsipher: you'll see coming up when I get to that slide. I don't want to jump ahead too much. But I really want you guys to not worry about the coding as much.

134
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.640
Darren Pulsipher: as… Your architecture and your design, and that you're using

135
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:15.479
Darren Pulsipher: Best practices, best methods that are known out there, and maybe even creating some of your own.

136
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:20.709
Darren Pulsipher: So, I'm trying to up your game, in that, which I've already kind of talked about.

137
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:27.280
Darren Pulsipher: Oh, Thursday class time. So, a little bit of a change from last semester.

138
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:41.469
Darren Pulsipher: every class that you attend, and you have your camera on, and you're engaged, you're gonna get 1%, you'll get one point for the class. There are 14 classes. You have an opportunity to get 14%.

139
00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:48.960
Darren Pulsipher: So, there's extra credit by attending class and participating. If you miss a class, this gives you an opportunity to miss 4 classes.

140
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.289
Darren Pulsipher: Right? With no penalties.

141
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:59.020
Darren Pulsipher: Right? That's something that's… that's new. But, you need to open your mouth. It's not me talking the whole time.

142
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:03.079
Darren Pulsipher: I will literally sit here and stare at you guys.

143
00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.530
Darren Pulsipher: Until you say something.

144
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:15.859
Darren Pulsipher: Right? The reason why is because I expect you guys to come prepared to talk in class. There are lectures that are out in GitHub.

145
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:29.599
Darren Pulsipher: That you can read. There will be videos and audio, that you can listen to, and I expect you guys to even, crack open your chat GPT or Claude, or whatever LLM you want.

146
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:36.809
Darren Pulsipher: or do a Google search, I don't care, but come to class ready to discuss

147
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:52.829
Darren Pulsipher: what the lectures covered, and the concepts around them, and even bring some world world experience into those. So the class schedule will be, at the first 15 minutes, I'll do a short lecture on one of the topics, for the week.

148
00:22:53.770 --> 00:23:10.500
Darren Pulsipher: And then there's an hour of us discussing. And I won't just have it us discussing the whole time. I'll have a couple activities that are breakout sessions, some question and answer type things, and and… but I really want you guys to bring something to the table.

149
00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.739
Darren Pulsipher: Where we're learning, all of us are learning together, not just…

150
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:21.190
Darren Pulsipher: me regurgitating a bunch of slides, because that's… that's not fun for anyone.

151
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.750
Darren Pulsipher: I'm including myself.

152
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.369
Darren Pulsipher: Okay? Any questions about that? Does that make sense?

153
00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.169
Darren Pulsipher: Alright, we're good, alright.

154
00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:37.399
Darren Pulsipher: What we're gonna cover, we're gonna cover modern web, programming platforms.

155
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:56.419
Darren Pulsipher: We're going to cover patterns for concurrency and parallel programming in microservice architectures. We're going to cover some of the development tools that are out there that help you with this. I will cover some Java Spring. It's an incredible platform if you like working in the Java environment.

156
00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:06.729
Darren Pulsipher: But I will also cover Node.js, Go, and Rust as well, and some of their platforms, and the benefits of using them.

157
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:23.319
Darren Pulsipher: We will also cover some generative AI techniques, and how to get the Gen AI to… and coerce the Gen AI to give you better responses, and to interact with it in a very productive way.

158
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:33.170
Darren Pulsipher: Some people in the past have had some hard times with GenAI, and have trusted implicitly, and it's led them down the wrong path.

159
00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:52.459
Darren Pulsipher: So, we're going to teach a lot about how to build up your knowledge so that you can actually ask generative AI important questions, and that you can be critical in thinking on how those, responses are coming back.

160
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.200
Darren Pulsipher: That's gonna be, important.

161
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.390
Darren Pulsipher: Okay?

162
00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:13.160
Darren Pulsipher: Some of the key frameworks that we're going to be using, we're going to talk about streams, we're going to talk about reactive streams, and structured concurrency. Those are kind of the three big, design pattern, groups that we're going to talk about in this course.

163
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:19.290
Darren Pulsipher: You will be able to architect things that can handle millions of messages.

164
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:35.029
Darren Pulsipher: And in an effective way. And I'm talking millions of messages in minutes, not in, hours. So we're going to talk about some of those different architectural design patterns that can handle that, and how to scale

165
00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.390
Darren Pulsipher: Up and scaled down appropriately.

166
00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:52.530
Darren Pulsipher: One of the… one of the big modern web platforms out there is Spring Boot. I will go over how it's architected and what the corollaries are in, some other languages.

167
00:25:52.530 --> 00:26:00.139
Darren Pulsipher: But key, platforms that we'll talk about is synchronous programming and asynchronous programming.

168
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.660
Darren Pulsipher: And the different, types of,

169
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:16.449
Darren Pulsipher: design patterns we're going to see in them, and also the benefits and the drawbacks to each one. That's going to be very important when it comes to you designing and architecting your solution.

170
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:22.939
Darren Pulsipher: Right? Based off of, you know, the project that you're going to work on.

171
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.389
Darren Pulsipher: In the past, we picked one project.

172
00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:44.449
Darren Pulsipher: I'm gonna be more nice than that. I'm going to give you the option between 5 different projects that you get to choose. I'm not gonna be as bold as last class, where you got to do whatever you felt like. This one, I even… I even have some starter data sets for you guys, which will help out quite a bit.

173
00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:50.659
Darren Pulsipher: Right? Some of the pattern, or some of the reasons why we want to use patterns.

174
00:26:50.690 --> 00:27:04.050
Darren Pulsipher: And we'll talk about how they interact with each other, is reusability. We know these work, why not use them? Maintainability, these patterns are well known and, easy to maintain.

175
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:23.470
Darren Pulsipher: Scalability, flexibility, and then, of course, best practices. Doug Schmidt, who taught this class before I started teaching it, has written a great book on design patterns. You can check out that PDF that's… that's right there. I will send these slides out, they will be put up on Brightspace as well, so you guys can get access to that.

176
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:29.960
Darren Pulsipher: Doug's a brilliant, software engineer, so, I… I feel kind of,

177
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:35.060
Darren Pulsipher: Humbled to take over his class like this, because he left me with a lot of great stuff.

178
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.040
Darren Pulsipher: So…

179
00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:48.010
Darren Pulsipher: The development environment will be using Git. You will hand your assignments into GitHub or GitLab, I don't care which one. I'll walk through how you submit assignments.

180
00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:59.839
Darren Pulsipher: I use IntelliJ, so you'll see a lot of the examples coming from IntelliJ, but you can use any of the IDEs out there, just make sure that the IDE has some kind of code assistant.

181
00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:14.769
Darren Pulsipher: in it that can read the repo that you're currently in. This will help you, because what happens is the code assistants are really a generative AI. They're a large language model that, use your repo as a mini-Rag.

182
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:31.670
Darren Pulsipher: Which is retrieval augmented generation. So when you are working through problems or coming up with your design and architecture, it will pull on the repo which has all the lectures and all the notes to the lectures in there. So it'll make your lives a lot easier, I'm hoping.

183
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.999
Darren Pulsipher: Right? That's kind of the idea behind it.

184
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.869
Darren Pulsipher: Any questions on that so far?

185
00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:41.589
Darren Pulsipher: Nope? Okay.

186
00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:59.799
Darren Pulsipher: Generative AI. Now, this is a big, this is a big thing for me. I actually, actually teach, workshops on generative AI for executives, and also for, common people, and for, also professors.

187
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:14.629
Darren Pulsipher: I've taught at universities, these, one-day workshops on generative AI, so I will be weaving some of that stuff that I teach in that workshop into the lectures and into our discussions on Thursday. Some of the things that I've learned

188
00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:20.899
Darren Pulsipher: From working with, lots of organizations and lots of different techniques that are out there.

189
00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:27.040
Darren Pulsipher: One thing I want you guys all to realize, you cannot trust Gen AI completely.

190
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:38.169
Darren Pulsipher: And depending on which one you use, you can trust it even less. One of the reasons why is the algorithms are set up

191
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:41.799
Darren Pulsipher: Specifically the public gen AIs.

192
00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.279
Darren Pulsipher: Are set up to give you an answer.

193
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:54.179
Darren Pulsipher: Regardless of whether it knows the answer or not, it will give you an answer. So, it will make things up.

194
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:59.070
Darren Pulsipher: And if any of you have any kids, especially, like, 5-year-olds.

195
00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:04.530
Darren Pulsipher: and 4-year-olds, you know that's what they do, too. If they don't know something.

196
00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.609
Darren Pulsipher: They will make up an answer because they want to please you.

197
00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:14.160
Darren Pulsipher: And that's about where we're at with GenAI. It will rarely tell you you're wrong.

198
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:19.420
Darren Pulsipher: It will rarely give an opinion unless you ask for it.

199
00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:38.619
Darren Pulsipher: So, we're gonna work through some different prompting techniques, to help us pull out of the Gen AI more information than we would normally get out of it, to help us make, design decisions and architectural decisions, and then to help us generate code.

200
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:47.829
Darren Pulsipher: Effectively, right? That's one of the big differences between Bibcoding and what we're gonna be, working with, Philip.

201
00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.380
Darren Pulsipher: So, I hope that… that helps.

202
00:30:50.580 --> 00:31:06.800
Darren Pulsipher: Like I mentioned earlier, all of the lectures, even the transcript of today's, call, I will be putting into, which is different than last semester, I'll be putting into the repo

203
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:17.240
Darren Pulsipher: So, you'll be getting the text-based transcripts of all this stuff. This will… this will help if you have questions on, hey, what went wrong in class last week?

204
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:24.240
Darren Pulsipher: you'll have all that access to all that raw data, and the LLM can find that information.

205
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:32.370
Darren Pulsipher: I do have a podcast, if you want to learn more about my philosophy around… around this sort of stuff.

206
00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:47.190
Darren Pulsipher: check out my podcast. That link is right there. I do believe that link still works. If not, let me know, and I'll get you a new link. I just revamped the website. And that might give you some insight into my philosophy around this stuff.

207
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:56.549
Darren Pulsipher: And my philosophy changes, so I'll just be honest with you. As I learn more things, I, you know, I'm up for making changes.

208
00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:57.460
Darren Pulsipher: Right.

209
00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.200
Darren Pulsipher: The, oh…

210
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:08.360
Darren Pulsipher: I should remove the word Java out of here. The course is really broken into three major sections.

211
00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.790
Darren Pulsipher: Structured concurrency and reactive systems.

212
00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:18.849
Darren Pulsipher: Synchronous and asynchronous web communications, and then software designing patterns.

213
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:23.260
Darren Pulsipher: Right? And you'll see that throughout the course, and you'll see it in the assignments as well.

214
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:24.700
Darren Pulsipher: Okay.

215
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:33.729
Darren Pulsipher: Please make sure that you review the modules, before class, because we're going to discuss them in class. I'm not just going to lecture.

216
00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:44.400
Darren Pulsipher: Right, so I expect you guys to come in ready to ask questions and to debate things together, and to come up with great solutions together as a group.

217
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:46.460
Darren Pulsipher: Okay.

218
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:50.829
Darren Pulsipher: Let's see, we went over some of this stuff…

219
00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:59.319
Darren Pulsipher: assessment philosophy. Here's another thing that might be new to some of you. There will not be written tests.

220
00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:04.270
Darren Pulsipher: In this class. There will be oral tests in this class.

221
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:20.490
Darren Pulsipher: There'll be a final. It'll be an interview. It's like a job interview. It's… it's not that painful, obviously, because 3 of my previous students have come back, so I didn't scare them away too bad. But it's a half hour, for the final.

222
00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:25.179
Darren Pulsipher: And we're doing a midterm, a midterm,

223
00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:42.280
Darren Pulsipher: This year as well. So that will be just you and I talking about what you've learned so far this semester, talking about the projects that you're working on, and the direction you're headed. And we're gonna have a discussion to talk about, areas of improvement.

224
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:47.429
Darren Pulsipher: Where you think you could grow more, and… and that's why we're doing the midterm.

225
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.229
Darren Pulsipher: Right? So…

226
00:33:49.270 --> 00:34:00.309
Darren Pulsipher: If you have a hard time, with, oral exams, please let me know, reach out to me, and we'll work something out. I'm not that scary.

227
00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:13.170
Darren Pulsipher: I had, one student last semester who was very worried about it, but we worked through it, and… and they… they did well in the class. So, I have some techniques to help, with that, right?

228
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:20.870
Darren Pulsipher: One of the reasons why I got rid of the written exams is, frankly, it's too tempting to use GenAI to answer the questions.

229
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.729
Darren Pulsipher: So, there's absolutely no way you can cheat in this class.

230
00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:32.500
Darren Pulsipher: So, you can try, you're not going to be able to, right? Because I've gotten rid of anything that lets you cheat.

231
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:34.780
Darren Pulsipher: So, there you go.

232
00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:50.800
Darren Pulsipher: Right, and so we're not doing anything written, everything will be oral. If you think you're really good at deepfake video, I have a deepfake video detector that we developed at Intel, so you won't get away with that one either, so…

233
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.989
Darren Pulsipher: I got you covered. Not a problem.

234
00:34:54.250 --> 00:35:14.250
Darren Pulsipher: Not a problem. I do grade all of the, assessments, but I use… I use GenAI to grade it. I have a rubric. You guys will see the rubric. I have some techniques that I use to grade your stuff. This semester, we… I am gonna have a little,

235
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:19.009
Darren Pulsipher: web client that I'll be hitting your services with.

236
00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:34.410
Darren Pulsipher: to see how they perform. So I'll be running that against your stuff. All your assignments will be handed in, and I'll also need a Docker container to run against. So, we'll set that up. You'll see in the first assignment how that's all going to work.

237
00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:49.520
Darren Pulsipher: Okay, so I'll be running a simple client that will test your interfaces. You'll have all the data that you need to run it against, so you should all be in good shape.

238
00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:57.179
Darren Pulsipher: And I do use, generative AI to run through all your code, find problems, and… and grade it.

239
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:58.230
Darren Pulsipher: Right.

240
00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.850
Darren Pulsipher: So, because I'm using Gen AI,

241
00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:06.479
Darren Pulsipher: You get a very well, as some of you have seen in the past.

242
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:23.540
Darren Pulsipher: It can be very explicit on things that you can improve on. I expect you to learn from those things. They're very good, they're very good at pointing out things specifically because of the prompting that I put in on the front end, things I'm looking for specifically, okay?

243
00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:25.529
Darren Pulsipher: Assignments are due.

244
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:35.590
Darren Pulsipher: on Sundays, which is horrible for me, by the way, but my students have… have spoken, and I have listened. They're due Sunday at midnight.

245
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:43.559
Darren Pulsipher: on, at midnight Tennessee time on the day, and you'll see in the assignments when they're due.

246
00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:49.250
Darren Pulsipher: There are 5 assignments. There are 4 assignments and a final project, right?

247
00:36:49.470 --> 00:37:06.960
Darren Pulsipher: The first assignment's very easy. It's setting up your environment and a baseline. It's just going to be, can you, set up a web service running in a Docker container that I can attach to, and I can do a health, and I can… I can do one or two API calls to it.

248
00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:11.129
Darren Pulsipher: REST API calls. That's the first assignment.

249
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:19.280
Darren Pulsipher: That's A0. A1 is, a little more than that. We're gonna start, looking at

250
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:32.809
Darren Pulsipher: implementing at least one service that deals with data. In that… in that one, I'll be querying data, I'll be loading data, and things like that. Then we'll move into integration and persistence and resilience.

251
00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:38.320
Darren Pulsipher: I'm gonna try and break your microservice. I have some really good techniques to do that.

252
00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:51.519
Darren Pulsipher: Especially since I'm getting your Docker containers. Then we're gonna move on to fully reactive and async pipelining and performance analysis. This is where I'm gonna throw several hundred clients

253
00:37:51.520 --> 00:38:02.229
Darren Pulsipher: And I have a whole, server farm behind me. I'm gonna see how well your stuff, can handle a bunch of clients just hammering your, Docker containers.

254
00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:21.269
Darren Pulsipher: And your architecture. So, we'll do that. And then your capstone project is, hey, can we make this production ready? Can we really make it resilient? Do I have observability? Can I deploy… automatically deploy it? We'll be using, we can use Docker,

255
00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:40.390
Darren Pulsipher: now I can't remember. Docker Swarm, thank you! We can use Docker Swarm for that instead of going full-blown Kubernetes. It's just a much easier platform to use. But if you guys want to use Kubernetes, that's fine too. So those are… those are kind of the details of the assignment.

256
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:44.179
Darren Pulsipher: There are 5 projects to choose from.

257
00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:50.740
Darren Pulsipher: That you get to choose. If you decide to switch projects partway through, you're more than welcome to do that.

258
00:38:50.760 --> 00:39:02.280
Darren Pulsipher: But I think that just adds more time to what you need to do. But the projects are a movie and media recommender, an IoT smart home sensor platform.

259
00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:15.739
Darren Pulsipher: Trisha should love that, because she's already written one in the last class. She'll just need to extend it a little bit. An online store, shopping cart, a social news feed, and a food delivery and restaurant ordering system.

260
00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:34.980
Darren Pulsipher: So, those are the five projects. You get to choose one of those projects you want to work… work on. I do have a bunch of synthetic data, both small, medium, and large, and I will be generating extra large for the final project, which should have a million

261
00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:38.280
Darren Pulsipher: data elements in it. That's what we're going after.

262
00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:41.659
Darren Pulsipher: Okay? I'm not providing you any starter code at all.

263
00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:46.590
Darren Pulsipher: That's something you're gonna have to learn how to do on your own.

264
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:55.479
Darren Pulsipher: And I've given you plenty of information on how to do that, and Gen AI can generate a lot of that stuff for you, or you can pick whatever platform you wish to pick.

265
00:39:55.620 --> 00:40:02.329
Darren Pulsipher: To do that, this is where research from you guys is gonna become important. You guys need to figure that out.

266
00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.879
Darren Pulsipher: Right? This is where your architecture heads come in.

267
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:06.730
Darren Pulsipher: Right?

268
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:19.399
Darren Pulsipher: I don't need to provide code for you that, something else can generate. This is how grading is going to happen. The first four assignments are worth 10 points each.

269
00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:27.490
Darren Pulsipher: Which is 40. The final project's worth 25. The final exam, the interview, will be worth 20%.

270
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:35.870
Darren Pulsipher: The weekly participation I already brought up is 10%, but you have a… you have a 4% kicker on that one if you attend all the classes.

271
00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:55.249
Darren Pulsipher: And there will be a midterm as well, which is worth 5 points, right? This is a check-in with me. It's a half hour. I will, put together a calendar, invite, so that you guys, can, schedule that, starting next week.

272
00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:57.900
Darren Pulsipher: You'll be able to schedule. That'll be sometime in March.

273
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:06.460
Darren Pulsipher: Right? And I am doing a little bit of traveling, but I will be calling into these Thursday meetings, no matter where in the world I am.

274
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:17.620
Darren Pulsipher: And sometimes it might be in India. In fact, I got a lot of travel. We almost had Tricia last semester in New Zealand. We were all jealous.

275
00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.190
Darren Pulsipher: But she, she didn't…

276
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:27.680
Tricia Brown: They're having me submit a visa for Australia, but everything's still pending, so… They're making some work travel.

277
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:41.519
Darren Pulsipher: I understand work travel, because I have it too. That's why I gave a little bit of slack, but I will dial in at 3 in the morning if I need to, to be with you guys, because I think we're going to have a lot of fun this semester.

278
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:48.049
Darren Pulsipher: Submitting assignments. All the assignments must be submitted through Brightspace.

279
00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:50.189
Darren Pulsipher: And all I need is a link.

280
00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:53.889
Darren Pulsipher: to your, GitHub repo. That's all I need.

281
00:41:54.300 --> 00:42:00.189
Darren Pulsipher: I do… it does need to be… you do need to put it in in time in Brightspace.

282
00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:08.440
Darren Pulsipher: the assignments are all in there already. And I do check the timestamp on the repo, so don't just slide it in and

283
00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:16.619
Darren Pulsipher: at midnight, and then keep working on it past it, because I will go to your timestamp, because I can do that in GitHub.

284
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:21.639
Darren Pulsipher: And whatever you checked in and committed before midnight is what I'm gonna take.

285
00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:22.840
Darren Pulsipher: Okay.

286
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:27.069
Darren Pulsipher: I do tell people, check in whenever you got.

287
00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:30.140
Darren Pulsipher: Even if it fails, you're still gonna get points.

288
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:36.190
Darren Pulsipher: Right? Another thing that I want to make sure that you guys do is…

289
00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:41.640
Darren Pulsipher: If you're having a conversation with a GenAI to help you make design decisions.

290
00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:54.130
Darren Pulsipher: Capture those, put those into your repo. Say, here's my conversation, here's how I made design decisions. I want to read that. That, to me, is more important than the code that gets generated.

291
00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:55.629
Darren Pulsipher: Philip, go ahead.

292
00:42:56.450 --> 00:43:01.459
Philip Eykamp: I was just gonna say, to the point of getting points for something that doesn't work.

293
00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:25.900
Philip Eykamp: I believe last term I got at least 90% on something that, like, didn't even fully run, so, and you probably remember this, but I was just gonna say, for everyone else in the room, lest anyone not take that seriously. My thing just, like, didn't work because I did not provision resources properly, or there was some… something that was basically a total showstopper, and, I mean, yeah, so, I mean, that is, like, more true than you might think.

294
00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:31.859
Darren Pulsipher: Yeah, and… because I'm more concerned about, are you guys learning the architectural…

295
00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:47.270
Darren Pulsipher: concepts and the design principles, more so than did your code compile… you guys don't even compile code anymore, what am I talking about? Did your code work completely correctly? I'm more concerned, is the design pattern correct?

296
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:53.209
Darren Pulsipher: we can work through the code issues later, right? And eventually, you will have to, right?

297
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:57.210
Darren Pulsipher: Because we do need… we do need the final project to actually run.

298
00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:58.290
Darren Pulsipher: Right?

299
00:43:58.650 --> 00:43:59.620
Darren Pulsipher: Okay?

300
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:10.300
Darren Pulsipher: Any questions? I do not take late assignments. There's no dog, I ate my homework, there's nothing like that. I just don't… I just don't have time to do late assignment, regrading.

301
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:18.639
Darren Pulsipher: Especially since things are handed in on a Sunday night. I used to have them handed in on a Friday, so I had all day Saturday to grade.

302
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:23.530
Darren Pulsipher: But not anymore. It's because I love my students so much.

303
00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:29.359
Darren Pulsipher: So… Typically, I have the grading done within 3 or 4 days.

304
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:30.900
Darren Pulsipher: Okay.

305
00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:41.839
Darren Pulsipher: Okay, key here, stay on top of the modules and the assignments, don't get too far behind. There's a lot of content we're gonna go through. A lot.

306
00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:47.769
Darren Pulsipher: Right? So… Also remember that the assignments build on top of each other.

307
00:44:47.840 --> 00:45:06.940
Darren Pulsipher: Join any discussions in the Brightspace group. We didn't do a great job on this last semester, because I think our discussions on Thursdays kind of displaced a lot of that, but that is a good place to share information, is in Brightspace as well. If you do have any questions, just send me an email.

308
00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:13.210
Darren Pulsipher: I tend to check the Vanderbilt email every day, so at least once a day, so…

309
00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:22.829
Darren Pulsipher: I'll normally get back to you. You can always reach out to me as well. I'll give some other information where you guys can reach out to me.

310
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:26.049
Darren Pulsipher: Okay, any questions from you guys?

311
00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.270
Darren Pulsipher: No questions.

312
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:36.529
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): The, sorry, I was looking at the Brightspace, the Brightspace site.

313
00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:42.100
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): And… I'm not seeing any of the modules, sorry if I missed that.

314
00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:51.520
Darren Pulsipher: They're not in there yet, and you won't see a lot in the Brightspace. Most of the modules, you're gonna see in the GitHub repo.

315
00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:53.080
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): Got it.

316
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:59.410
Darren Pulsipher: And so what I will put on the weekly modules is I'll put

317
00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:14.970
Darren Pulsipher: maybe I should just… I'll go through and I'll put a link on those weekly modules to the… to the modules in the GitHub repo. That'll be the easiest way to do it. And the reason I do the GitHub repo is because I can add that as a LLM rag

318
00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:18.960
Darren Pulsipher: In your development environments.

319
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.950
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): Sorry, that's amazing.

320
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:22.949
Darren Pulsipher: I can't really do much with them, right?

321
00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:27.039
Darren Pulsipher: So, I hope that helps, Tom.

322
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:30.230
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): No, that, that, that, that absolutely does. And…

323
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:36.030
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): And then for the GitHub repo, Where are we finding… That…

324
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:39.210
Darren Pulsipher: I'm gonna send… I'm gonna send out an email with…

325
00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:39.760
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): Got it.

326
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.650
Darren Pulsipher: Yep, I'll send out an email to the whole team with the link.

327
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:57.420
Darren Pulsipher: The, this, this is week zero, by the way. Week one, which starts next, this week, the lectures are up there. Only one video is done, so far. The other videos will be coming,

328
00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:00.319
Darren Pulsipher: Oh, on Saturday, more than likely.

329
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:15.959
Darren Pulsipher: The videos are only about 15-20 minutes tops. Most of, most of the information is in the lecture notes and also in the PowerPoint presentation, which is in a Markdown language format.

330
00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:21.299
Darren Pulsipher: So they're easy to read, they're easy for an LLM to take advantage of as well.

331
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.229
Darren Pulsipher: So, good questions. Any other questions?

332
00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.910
Darren Pulsipher: All right. Tom, I know you had to go grab your wife.

333
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:33.920
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): Yes.

334
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.759
Darren Pulsipher: get through that quickly. Thank you.

335
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.879
Darren Pulsipher: So, we do have a little bit more time, and I do want

336
00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.649
Darren Pulsipher: You guys to share a little bit.

337
00:47:46.690 --> 00:48:01.580
Darren Pulsipher: Some of you guys know each other already, but some of you don't, so just give me a couple minutes on who you are, and if you're working right now, if you're a full-time student, what you'd like to be called?

338
00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:14.879
Darren Pulsipher: We've had… I've… we've had people who put their name down, and they don't want to be called that. So, let's start with Eric. I already know Eric from my last class, so… Eric, go ahead and introduce yourself for everyone.

339
00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:21.809
Eric Farber-Eger: Hi everyone, I'm Eric Farber-Eger. I work as a Principal Application Developer for Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

340
00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:39.769
Eric Farber-Eger: mostly in EHR-derived research, so I'm in data all the time. Haven't worked too much with microservices, so I'm excited to learn a little bit more about this. Yeah, about me, I've got, 2 kids, 4 and 2. I've got 3 cats, I live in Nashville, Tennessee.

341
00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:44.569
Eric Farber-Eger: And I've been doing programming for about 15 years now, so,

342
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:52.959
Eric Farber-Eger: is excited to get back to school. This will be my last semester, hopefully, fingers crossed, if I can pass this one, but last semester.

343
00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.870
Darren Pulsipher: Oh, okay, you gotta pass this class?

344
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:58.169
Eric Farber-Eger: Yeah, yeah. It's in your hands.

345
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:59.410
Darren Pulsipher: in my hands.

346
00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:00.669
Eric Farber-Eger: Or mine, I guess I should say.

347
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:01.699
Darren Pulsipher: Hey, it's in yours.

348
00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:02.320
Eric Farber-Eger: Yes.

349
00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:08.869
Darren Pulsipher: We had two students, last semester that, graduated, so, so, it is doable.

350
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.180
Darren Pulsipher: It is doable.

351
00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.300
Eric Farber-Eger: Yeah, yeah.

352
00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:14.879
Darren Pulsipher: Thanks, Eric. Alright, is it Martina?

353
00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:17.250
Martina Nikic: Yeah, it's Martina.

354
00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.790
Darren Pulsipher: Alright, Martina?

355
00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:33.709
Martina Nikic: Nikitch, most people don't get my last name right, but, hi everyone. I was out for about a year, out of school. I became a full-time mom. I am a.

356
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:35.190
Darren Pulsipher: Congratulations.

357
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:43.539
Martina Nikic: Thank you. I'm a full-time software engineer. I work for a company called Civic Eye, so we make software basically for,

358
00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:50.810
Martina Nikic: Police officers, law enforcement, prosecutors, all over the country.

359
00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:58.600
Martina Nikic: A little bit about me, I'm originally from Eastern Europe, I'm fluent in…

360
00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:04.319
Martina Nikic: three human languages, and I live in Chattanooga, Tennessee, so…

361
00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:08.660
Darren Pulsipher: Wait, 3 human… which human languages?

362
00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:12.250
Martina Nikic: So I'm fluent in German, and I'm fluent in Serbo-Croatian.

363
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:19.909
Martina Nikic: And English. And English, that's awesome. That is awesome. So, I'm guessing you're from that area, from Serbia?

364
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:23.340
Martina Nikic: Oh, yeah. I'm a Bosnian Croat, yeah.

365
00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:25.720
Darren Pulsipher: Oh, that is awesome. That is awesome.

366
00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.039
Martina Nikic: So I like languages.

367
00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:33.269
Darren Pulsipher: Well, great. Alright, Tom, you're up next, if you're still there.

368
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:37.210
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): I am, I just tried to get off mute, can you guys hear me?

369
00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:38.329
Darren Pulsipher: Yep, yeah, we can.

370
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:44.729
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): Yeah, and I apologize, so this will be from the car, but, so Tom Gaffney, I guess I, I…

371
00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.239
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): I've worked for the last…

372
00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:59.109
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): Oh, gosh. Getting close to 20 years now, still not quite, but, in financial services. So, started, well, started my career in private equity, real estate, private equity, but that was in 2007, and…

373
00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:18.699
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): you guys may remember, it wasn't the best time to be in real estate. After that, kind of, yeah, shortly moved into, a commodities trading role, and sort of kept that over the last, few years, kind of bouncing around to a couple of different firms. Spent the last 10 years at kind of a mid-sized financial services firm.

374
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:20.720
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): But as part of that, I guess.

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:36.260
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): maybe about 15 years ago, I'm starting to get pretty interested into, you know, the different kind of financial modeling and things that we could build, you know, starting, like, you know, I feel like a lot of people do. Things like VBA is kind of a gateway programming drug, moving into kind of Python, R…

376
00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:42.709
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): You know, over the years, kind of took a series of courses through Stanford to kind of

377
00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:56.210
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): kind of bulk up some of my computer science, University of Washington's kind of same thing. And then, yeah, sort of took the opportunity here at Vanderbilt to, to really sort of formalize all that, education into, the master's program, so…

378
00:51:56.210 --> 00:52:03.529
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): Working on a few projects at work right now that hopefully that work… that this has already been really kind of, impactful in. We're…

379
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:13.930
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): We're building kind of an operational platform to manage our physical commodity trading. It's called the CTRM Commodity Trading and Risk Management System. Definitely some of the ad hoc modeling, so…

380
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:25.769
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): Yeah, I guess it's me in a nutshell. Born and raised in Alaska, kind of live in Seattle today, live kind of all around the country, went to school in Philadelphia, spent some time in DC, Houston, San Francisco.

381
00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:28.560
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): And then one son who's,

382
00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:32.629
Thomas Gaffney’s iPhone (2): About 12 days old, so, freshly minted.

383
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:36.619
Darren Pulsipher: That's awesome. Congratulations on that.

384
00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:39.909
Darren Pulsipher: Alright, Trisha. Trisha, you're up next.

385
00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:59.509
Tricia Brown: Hello, I'm Trisha Brown. I'm currently a software engineer for Boeing on, the vehicle training systems. I've been working there for about 4 years, and currently living in St. Louis, Missouri, but I was born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt was big.

386
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:09.869
Tricia Brown: part of the family for me. I have a lot of family and friends that are alums, so I figured if Boeing's paying for me to get the degree and the price tag's not on me, I'm gonna do it, so…

387
00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.230
Darren Pulsipher: That's awesome, Tricia.

388
00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:17.309
Darren Pulsipher: Welcome back. Alright, Phillip, your last… But not least.

389
00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:34.770
Philip Eykamp: Well, I'm Philip Eichamp, resident of Nashville, Tennessee. In my final course, so along with Eric, I will be, hopefully graduating at the end of this term, and and yeah, I, I do basically, like, ID consulting software.

390
00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:47.530
Philip Eykamp: design, basically whatever my, firm, NTT data has me doing on client work. Also, in the very early stages of a potential startup, but, you know,

391
00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:53.689
Philip Eykamp: kind of like throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping it sticks, but we'll see. And yeah,

392
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:55.390
Philip Eykamp: I guess,

393
00:53:55.850 --> 00:54:00.560
Philip Eykamp: I don't know how much else to say… what else is useful to say other than that,

394
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:09.069
Philip Eykamp: Yeah, I was probably, quite, relatively vivacious last term, so we'll see if I, have a repeat performance.

395
00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:22.259
Darren Pulsipher: I'm hoping so, Philip. You always, you always did a great job at questioning, which is, to me, the best way to learn, is that we talk together, we learn together through mutual experiences that… that we have.

396
00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.490
Darren Pulsipher: So, I appreciate that, Philip.

397
00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:29.090
Darren Pulsipher: All right, guys, you have any questions for me at all?

398
00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:37.239
Darren Pulsipher: Besides why my phone is ringing off the hook, Phillip knows why my phone's ringing off the hook. It is my birthday today.

399
00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:43.529
Darren Pulsipher: So, and I do have 10 kids, and they're all calling me, so…

400
00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:50.500
Darren Pulsipher: I'm gonna be on the phone for the next, couple hours, after this class, so…

401
00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.620
Darren Pulsipher: But… Happy birthday!

402
00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:53.430
Philip Eykamp: day.

403
00:54:53.430 --> 00:55:06.550
Darren Pulsipher: Well, thank you very much. So, I will… I will post up on, Brightspace, the GitHub, GitHub repo, and also, I'll send an email out to… out to everyone.

404
00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:19.720
Darren Pulsipher: And we'll also post the transcript of this into the repo. You will see, updates to the repo every week, as I am going through and recording the lectures for, for that week.

405
00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:30.909
Darren Pulsipher: I tried to say I was gonna do it over the Christmas break, but there was too much chaos going on over here, at my house when, several of the kids came home.

406
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:37.469
Darren Pulsipher: Which… the house kind of shudders when they all start rolling home with their… with their kids, so…

407
00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:49.759
Darren Pulsipher: I understand, work-life balance, that it is out of balance, especially when you're in school. I got my PhD while I was working full-time, and had,

408
00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:56.189
Darren Pulsipher: during COVID, when 7 of my 10 kids came back home during COVID.

409
00:55:56.330 --> 00:56:02.309
Darren Pulsipher: And we'd already gotten rid of most of them, so it was… it was a crazy time, so…

410
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:07.840
Darren Pulsipher: So, I understand a working professional… working professional students,

411
00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:21.130
Darren Pulsipher: And hopefully this course, will give you enough time to use some things in your own jobs, as well as, get some value out of it for your careers long-term.

412
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:34.090
Darren Pulsipher: All right, guys, that's all I got, for today. Next week, you'll only get 15 minutes out of me, and the rest is you guys. So, we're gonna have a lot of fun next, next week.

413
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:47.320
Darren Pulsipher: So, take a look at those lectures. Like I said, the text is already up there, an email will go out, and the rest of the videos will be up by Saturday.

414
00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:49.930
Darren Pulsipher: Okay.

415
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:52.460
Darren Pulsipher: Alright guys, thank you so much!

416
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:57.260
Darren Pulsipher: And I look forward to, a great, A great semester.

417
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:58.649
Tricia Brown: Thank you.

418
00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.290
Eric Farber-Eger: Thank you, and happy birthday.

419
00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:01.060
Martina Nikic: Bye.

420
00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:01.990
Philip Eykamp: Thanks, bye.
