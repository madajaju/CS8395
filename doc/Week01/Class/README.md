Dr. Darren Pulsipher, an instructor at Vanderbilt University, delivered the first lecture of his microservice architecture course, outlining the semester's structure, expectations, and key concepts. He emphasized a shift in focus from coding to architectural design and the strategic use of generative AI, distinguishing his approach from "vibecoding." Darren explained the course's philosophy, content, and assessment methods, including oral exams and a final project, while highlighting the importance of architectural decisions in modern software engineering. He also introduced the concept of structured concurrency, reactive systems, and asynchronous programming, and discussed the use of tools like Docker and IntelliJ. Students were encouraged to engage actively in class discussions and to leverage resources like GitHub repos and LLMs for learning. The session concluded with an overview of the course's structure, assignments, and grading, and students introduced themselves, sharing their backgrounds and interests in the field.

# Next Steps

1. Darren: Send email to all students with the link to the GitHub repo for the course.
2. Darren: Post the GitHub repo link and the transcript of this meeting in Brightspace.
3. Darren: Post updates to the GitHub repo every week, including new lecture recordings and materials by Saturday.
4. Darren: Set up a calendar invite for students to schedule their midterm oral interviews starting next week.
5. All students: Review the modules in the GitHub repo before the next class.
6. All students: Submit assignments via Brightspace as a link to their GitHub or GitLab repo, including a Docker container for each assignment.
7. All students: Capture and include in their repo any conversations with GenAI used for design decisions.
8. All students: Schedule their midterm oral interview using the calendar invite once it is available.
