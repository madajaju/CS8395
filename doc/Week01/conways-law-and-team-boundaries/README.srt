1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,066
This lecture talks about Conway's
laws and time boundaries.

2
00:00:03,066 --> 00:00:06,333
Now, Conway's Law is an option.

3
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:07,466
When we look at systems.

4
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:08,300
Architecture fits

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,000
really well for microservices
and these new architectures that we have.

6
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:15,366
So we're going to understand
what Conway's Law is.

7
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:19,300
See how organizational structures
are shapes systems design.

8
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:22,066
And then we're going to learn
about some team boundaries.

9
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:23,666
Make sure that they're intentional

10
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,866
with your architectural boundaries
that you have.

11
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:29,566
And be aware of some common risk
and trade offs when using this technique.

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,366
Now, Conway,
where Conway's Law was developed

13
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,366
by Melvin Conway back in 1968,

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,600
and he basically said this organizations
that design systems

15
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,966
produce designs
that are copies of communication

16
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:46,966
structures
and channels of those organizations.

17
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:50,266
So in other words,
the way that people communicate

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,533
shapes the architecture of
the systems that they build.

19
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:58,133
So we've seen this time and time again.

20
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,433
And when we talk about systems
back in the 1968,

21
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:04,000
these were not like necessarily
computer systems.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,233
They were systems in general.

23
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:08,866
So a lot of process in engineering
and things like that was going on.

24
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:13,200
The great news is,
is that these sorts of techniques exist

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,133
today and can be leveraged when you're
designing your microservice architecture.

26
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,000
So why it matters.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,300
Well, first off,
the architecture mirrors team boundaries.

28
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:27,133
Departmen one budget lines, time
zones, and locations,

29
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:29,000
vendor and regulatory boundaries.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Those are some architectural boundaries
that we can look at.

31
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,100
And if we can identify those
and we can do a better job at

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,566
creating our microservices to mimic
that when they're misaligned.

33
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,500
What happens is
I have higher coordination costs.

34
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:48,600
Slower delivery
times, longer lead times, unclear

35
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,433
ownership and blame
shifting starts happening.

36
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,700
Now you would say, well, Darren,
that's for the 1960s, 1970s.

37
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,166
Sorts of things were processed.

38
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:03,933
World today same things happened today
with microservice architectures,

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,966
especially when you've got teams
that are focus on one architecture.

40
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:10,966
There's a lot of finger
pointing on whose fault that was.

41
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:14,633
So these same techniques can be used
in microservice architectures today.

42
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:19,366
So when they're aligned, when everything's
aligned,

43
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:23,466
things move faster, safer to make changes.

44
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:25,966
There's clear ownership of components.

45
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:28,966
Architecture
that evolves more smoothly happens

46
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,300
and it mimics
what's going on in the real world.

47
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,833
So there's some benefits when they're
light right now good and bad alignment.

48
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:41,266
This is really easy to define right
when you when it's happening right.

49
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:45,600
When you've got good
alignment business capabilities,

50
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,166
are aligned to teams.

51
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:53,866
So for example payments catalog
onboarding these these sorts of things

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,133
that I've got full stacks
that are for the category team,

53
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:03,600
for the payments team, when you've got
one team that manage their part and it's

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,333
mostly independent of the other parts,
you have low coupling, high cohesion.

55
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:12,400
So which we've learned in software
engineering,

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,900
that's that's really important.

57
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,033
When you've got bad alignment,
what happens is teams are aligned to

58
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:23,466
technology layers UI team, API team,
database team and infrastructure team.

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,500
What happens is you create
high coupling between the components

60
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:30,733
and between the organizational structure

61
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:33,833
and which increases lots of

62
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:37,133
handoffs, slow feedback loops,
all those sorts of things happen.

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,566
So remember, you cannot architect
a microservice architecture

64
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,700
without understanding
the organization that you're working in.

65
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:48,600
You can cause a lot of problems.

66
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,200
All right.

67
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,000
There's another technique out there
called the inverse Conway maneuver.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,866
Now what this says is I have my structure

69
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,266
of my, solution structure. Right.

70
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,400
My microservice architecture structure.

71
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,400
And I'm going to align
my organizational structure to match.

72
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:09,566
Now, this can be highly effective,
especially if you can leverage

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,600
a lot of software techniques
like reuse and,

74
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:16,966
portability and things like that.

75
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:17,933
Right.

76
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:20,866
If I want to leverage
those sorts of benefits of,

77
00:04:20,866 --> 00:04:25,233
I only have to write one database
application that rules them all. Then

78
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,366
aligning
your team structure to that may work.

79
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:30,633
But here's the problem.

80
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:33,633
Organizational structures
have a lot of inertia.

81
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,166
They're very hard to change.

82
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,166
Especially
they've been around a long time right.

83
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:43,266
So you may want to do that, but
you may find much more difficult to do.

84
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Now some people try and use the inverse
Conway maneuver

85
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,966
to kind of circumvent Conway's
Law and defeat it.

86
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:52,566
That doesn't work, right.

87
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:56,033
Because what you end up doing
is you end up putting another layer

88
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:59,933
of abstraction in there, and that can't
handle the changes very effectively.

89
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:04,666
And all you've done
is, move to the park, around the ice,

90
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,800
to a different place, and it really didn't
solve the problem at all.

91
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:08,833
Right.

92
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:13,166
So if you want to try the inverse, 
maneuver,

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,533
then you define your architecture first,

94
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:19,533
then you create your team structure
around that architecture.

95
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,100
It could be very difficult to do, but,

96
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,466
you know, it's it's
one of the things that, is possible.

97
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,266
Right?

98
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:29,266
You still can't ignore Conway's Law here.

99
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,166
It doesn't get you around it.

100
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,133
It's just you're taking
it from a different angle.

101
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,633
All right.

102
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:36,466
Let's talk about misaligned boundaries.

103
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:40,533
How do I know that my microservice
architecture has bad boundary,

104
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,566
boundaries around it, right?

105
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:46,500
First off, if a small feature requires

106
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,866
3 to 5 different teams
and or microservices,

107
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,766
then you've drawn poor boundaries.

108
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:55,000
Make sense?

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,066
If I have frequent cross team meetings
for minor changes.

110
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:03,233
Bad, bad boundary alignment.

111
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,366
Okay.

112
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:07,366
If shared services or modules
with funny ownership.

113
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:11,566
Oh, we created this shared module,
but we don't know who owns it.

114
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:12,133
Right.

115
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:13,600
Is everyone owns it.

116
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,266
Bad misaligned boundary.

117
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:17,433
Walk away from that. Right.

118
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:19,100
You got to Re-Architect.

119
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,666
If the roadmap conflicts
with the same code over database areas,

120
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:24,500
then I've got misalignment.

121
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,066
If architectural diagrams
show clean domains,

122
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,666
but the repos and services mirror
the old architecture, then

123
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:35,266
you have misalignment in your architecture
and your implementation.

124
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,866
Right? Another, another symptom.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,466
All right.

126
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:43,166
So let's look at some principles
to help us design better boundaries.

127
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:45,766
Right. Follow value streams.

128
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:48,766
Look at the value stream
of what's being produced.

129
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,500
And look at those value streams
to draw some great boundaries there.

130
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:56,833
Also optimize your architecture
for change.

131
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:59,866
Aim for the most changes
to be done by one team.

132
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:03,666
Instead of
I need three teams to make this change.

133
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:07,533
So look at look at your architecture
and figure out, all right,

134
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,266
where can I do that? The most?

135
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:13,133
That all goes into that
decoupling and cohesion.

136
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,766
That we want high cohesion, low coupling.

137
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:16,600
Right.

138
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Limit
the cognitive load by giving each team

139
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:24,733
a specific coherent domain instead of
multiple domains or sets of systems.

140
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:27,533
It's very hard
for someone to keep track of everything.

141
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:30,300
And then also last one,
make sure your interfaces between

142
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,033
the microservices are explicit
with clear APIs,

143
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:39,733
events, and contracts
between the different microservices.

144
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:43,733
And that will, reduce the ad hoc,
coordination that you need.

145
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:45,833
All right.

146
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,266
Let's talk about using Conway's Law.

147
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,766
In practice,
when planning the architecture, go out

148
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:53,966
and find out who your teams are
and what they own,

149
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:57,700
what processes they own,
what data they own.

150
00:07:57,966 --> 00:07:59,700
All those things are very important.

151
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,966
Also, find out how many teams are involved
in a typical feature

152
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:08,800
or typical service that you're delivering
to your customers out there.

153
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,233
Also, when you're planning
organizational changes,

154
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:15,233
look at what architectural changes

155
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,666
need to be made or what naturally emerge
from this new structure, right?

156
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:24,966
So it's almost like, a dance
between your microservice architectures

157
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:25,933
and your org change.

158
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:28,933
Remember, the org change is leading

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,400
typically, right?

160
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,966
They're slower to change.

161
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:36,600
I can change code much faster
if I architect it correctly

162
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,566
than the organization can change.

163
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:40,833
All right.

164
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,400
When when you know
that the change you're making is wrong.

165
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,600
Slow delivery.

166
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,500
Constant integration. Friction.

167
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Unclear ownership. Right?

168
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:53,566
Remember, it's not just code.

169
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,666
You're dealing with people here.

170
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,033
And that's really important to understand.

171
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:58,633
All right some key takeaways.

172
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:03,000
System architecture tends to mirror
communication structures okay.

173
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:07,566
Team boundaries are very important
to making architectural decisions.

174
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:08,333
Right.

175
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:13,400
And they will actually be, 
an architectural decision in disguise.

176
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,400
So you might as well uncover it
and identify it.

177
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,200
Use the inverse Conway maneuver to steer

178
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,200
the architecture via team designs
if you have to,

179
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,766
and then align the teams with business
capabilities best, which can.

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,866
This is an opportunity for you
to make some fundamental

181
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:32,000
digital transformation
changes in your organization.

182
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,866
And then last but not least,
watch for symptoms of misalignment

183
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:40,033
costs, explosion coordination

184
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:43,566
cost, confusion, slow change,
lack of ownership.

185
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:45,266
Those are the things
that you need to look for.
