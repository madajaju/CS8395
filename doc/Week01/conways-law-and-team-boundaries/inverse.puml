note right of ARCH
  1. Start from desired
     architecture: domains,
     services, modules.
end note

note right of ORG
  2. Design teams so that
     ownership mirrors those
     architectural boundaries.
end note

legend right
  You cannot defeat Conway's Law,
  but you can:
  • Ignore it and suffer, or
  • Use it on purpose.
