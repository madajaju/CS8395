Good afternoon, good evening. How's everyone doing today?
6:12
Hello. How are you? Hello. Good. How are you? All right. I see some old familiar faces.
6:18
And some new ones. I do like to see people's faces, just so you guys know. Uh we'll do cameras on on
6:26
the on these sessions on Thursdays. Um which we'll go over a little bit today.
6:31
Um we'll give a couple more minutes because I do believe there's eight 8 to
6:37
10 people um scheduled. Let me double check real quick.
6:54
All right, more people are joining. All right.
7:00
Well, then come on.
7:06
Phillip I recognize. How was everyone's Christmas uh
7:14
and New Year's break? Hopefully people got some time off.
7:21
Oh yeah, it was good. Lots of chasing the kids around. That's always fun. I spend my time
7:27
chasing my kids out. They are gone.
7:33
My wife and I are finally empty nesters. So, it's kind of nice.
7:41
So, let's see. I just logged in. Let's see how many other people we have. Well,
7:48
you guys obviously were able to see the the bright uh was it called? Brightpace.
7:56
Yes. All right. Let's see.
8:03
[Music] Okay.
8:08
We should uh we're expecting a couple more people then we'll get kicked off.
8:17
Wait, Tom has joined twice. Okay, that helps. Yeah, that's I guess adds to the count.
8:24
But the uh Yeah, sorry. I just I have my cell phone on one and one of the uh the big screen on the other.
8:30
No problem. Put the cell phone for the video. Um we'll we'll go ahead and get started.
8:36
Um now that we're a couple minutes after, um let me introduce myself uh real quick. Um I'm Dr. Darren Pulsifer.
8:44
Um, you can just call me uh Darren or Dr. Darren. No one can ever get my name
8:50
right all the time on my last name. Um, I've been teaching for at Vanderbilt for
8:56
over a year now. Um, I taught this class before, but I completely revamped it.
9:02
Um, because of uh a philosophy that I'm kind of taking um, and we had quite a bit of
9:10
success with with some adjustments, which uh, the people that had my class last semester, you're going to see some
9:16
of the adjustments this uh, semester to make uh, to make things better. And I think one of the reasons why we I've
9:22
changed things so so much is because of uh technology changes in the world
9:28
around generative AI specifically. And my goal that I have for you guys is
9:36
that first off when you're done with this that you can get jobs because that's important, right? because I know
9:44
I I've I've got uh 10 kids, so I know what it means to support a family and to
9:50
support yourselves. Um, and with the with everything that's going on, especially around computer science and
9:58
and software engineering, I think it's important that we up our game. So, you're going to find in this class,
10:03
we're going to up our game quite a bit and start thinking at a much higher level. um then um I'm not going to be
10:10
concerned about code as much as I am design patterns in architecture and
10:17
making sure that you guys make architectural decisions that are wise instead of just being able to
10:23
regurgitate an API from a language. Um and the reason I think the big shift is
10:31
because I can have generative AI do that for me all day long. That's that's what they're good at is regurgitation.
10:38
Um, so I'm going to try and up up up your game. Um, basically,
10:43
um, this course is microser scalable microser architectures and we're going to add some resilience and security in
10:50
there as well. Um, in the past, this class has been taught by some incredible, incredible computer
10:57
scientists that have written books and published papers and contributed to the
11:02
Java Spring framework. We're not covering Java Spring this time. uh if you want to you can um instead we're
11:10
going to talk about the design patterns and architectural decisions. It will be a multi- language um course. We'll be
11:18
working in um whatever languages you want frankly um as long as it can um handle the
11:26
design patterns. There will be some um what's the right word? There will be
11:32
some uh wise ways to choose things. In my last class, we had a student that
11:38
decided to make his life so much harder than it had to be. And those that are in the class know exactly who I'm talking
11:44
about. Um he learned a lot. He learned an awful lot. Um but he made his job a
11:52
lot harder. So I suggest looking at best practices and and
11:58
guidance in the lectures. they will help you uh make wise decisions um in in what
12:04
you decide to do. This may be uncomfortable for some of you guys because you're going to be used some of
12:09
your courses that you've had in the past, you're used to code already written for you and frameworks already
12:15
set up for you and test cases you need to pass. You're not getting any of that from me. None.
12:22
um because that in fact I took the core I took this
12:28
exact course um over the summer and I took the final assignment and I pumped
12:34
it into a juni which is a uh a genai on steroids with intelligj and it finished
12:42
the whole course all the assignments in 10 minutes
12:48
pass 100%. And I said, 'You know what?
12:54
I'm not gonna I'm not going to do that to you guys because I think um that would be if I if I just gave you the
13:00
same assignment, that would be a detriment to you. Um and I I just don't
13:06
think that's worth your time and your effort um to be able to regurgitate what a Genai can do for you. So, we're going
13:13
to focus a lot on architectural decisions in in Genai, and you'll see that in in the courses. and Eric and
13:20
Trisha and Philip have had my course uh not this course but uh last semester so
13:26
they know kind of the approach that I'm going to take. So any questions on that uh so far uh from you guys?
13:36
No. Okay. I I do I do have a a slide
13:42
presentation I will show. I normally Oh, go ahead, Philip. Actually, um I I do have a question perhaps
13:48
slightly in Jess but not totally. Um I I would love to hear again uh because I
13:53
think you discussed this last term how you would differentiate between uh what you're teaching us and vibe coding just
14:00
because that term has become a scourge on our industry. Yeah. So I'm going to teach you I'm
14:08
going to teach you how to direct a genai to help you make wise architecture
14:13
decisions. the code is secondary.
14:21
Um and one of the reasons why I say that is I truly believe that in the next five
14:27
years maybe maybe less than that there um that Gen AI will start um generating
14:35
machine code directly or a different kind of code that's not human readable
14:41
um but that is machine readable that can go to machine code and talk at the at
14:48
the microode level Um, I I truly believe that that could uh
14:54
that could happen. So, uh, no no problem to uh uh you go by Tom or Thomas.
15:05
Sorry, mute button. I go by Tom. All right. So, so Tom, I'll dive right in. Um, so you know what's on on track
15:12
and then we can have a discussion after that because I don't want you to miss uh kind of the meat of what we have planned
15:18
today. So, let me share my screen here. Does that answer your uh question, Philip?
15:26
Uh, yes. Thank you. All right. Philip will always uh challenge me,
15:32
which is exactly what I want to hear. So, all right. Um, so we'll talk about
15:40
course philosophy, uh, the course contents, uh, the structure of the lecture material, which you guys will
15:46
get used to, and then the assignments, and we'll talk about grading and how to set up your dev environment and all
15:52
that. Um, course philosophy. This one is really important. I don't see you guys
15:59
as coders. I see you as not even software developers. I see you more as
16:04
software engineers and architects and I'm going to treat you as such. You you guys are
16:10
all master students. So, um we're going to think at a lot um higher level than
16:16
um just script monkeys, right? Um if you want to learn a language, you're free to
16:22
do that on your own time, right? Um let's just put it that way. Okay? Um and
16:28
you will be learning a lot of new techniques and maybe even a new language during this course. Um we are going to
16:35
learn how to write concurrent and massively parallel microser architectures. Um it will require uh I
16:44
am going to I am going to have you guys using Docker uh which we'll talk about. Um but you do not need a cloud
16:51
environment to do this. You can run all this stuff on your uh desktops or
16:56
laptops. If you want to run it in a cloud and go hogwell crazy, you're more than welcome to do that as well because
17:02
we're going to focus on the different design patterns and architectures throughout this uh course. Okay.
17:10
Um one of the reasons why, and this this is really easy, just so
17:15
you guys know, I work at Intel Corporation. um that's my uh my full-time job. This
17:23
I'm doing because I enjoy teaching. And one thing I want to get across to you
17:28
guys is even though we're in a part of uh technology right now that's moving so
17:34
rapidly. Um, we've seen these before and there
17:39
have been several times that and I don't know if you guys know Moore's law but Moore's law basically says that every
17:46
two years the number of transistors doubles in the same amount of space. That's Moore's law. The ramifications of
17:53
Moore's law says that speed doubles every two years. Um, which in the long
18:01
term has really happened. We've been told several times by industry leaders
18:08
um that uh Moore's law is dead. And anytime someone says that there's a
18:14
major breakthrough and one um and the reason I bring this up is because this
18:21
shows you how rapidly things are growing. And because they're growing so rapidly,
18:27
we as software architects and software engineers need to understand
18:34
um that kind of growth so that we can architect systems that can last beyond a
18:39
year and a half or two years. Right? So understanding that technology
18:45
is going to advance even beyond um some of our architectures or some of our
18:51
coding that we've done our architectures still need to be sound and solid moving
18:56
forward. Uh some of the best examples of that there is an organization
19:02
um there there is an organization out there um called let's see if I get it right
19:09
DCMA they are in charge of all the defense contracts for the United States um
19:16
department of war right all of them um the software is the oldest piece of
19:22
software running in the world today it's written in cobalt and it is running on a mainframe
19:30
and it is almost 60 years old. So that architecture has withtood all
19:37
this change. They've tried several times to uh to migrate it off of the mainframe
19:42
onto something more modern and this is where things fell apart because the core
19:48
foundation of that architecture is solid but they built a spaghetti mess around it and they can't move it without
19:54
destroying everything. So we want to make sure that we're architecting things that can be extended easily but also
20:01
migrated as well. So we're going to work on on those types of architectures. Okay, that's why I bring up more as
20:07
well. Um let's go to the next slide here.
20:13
Oh, and I forgot to hit the record button. No, it's already recording, right?
20:19
I think I already set it up. Yeah, it says recording on my side. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Um, one one
20:26
thing I want to make sure that that we um look at in
20:31
in in this course is we're going to be doing a lot of things, but we're also going to be discussing a lot of things
20:37
because I I see there's a lot of real value in in our Thursday calls as these
20:43
not being just Darren lecturing, but us discussing. And um one change that we're going to
20:51
make this um semester over last semester, you'll see coming up when I
20:56
get to that slide. I don't want to jump ahead too too much, but I really want you guys to not worry about the coding
21:03
as much as your architecture and your design and that you're using best
21:10
practices, best methods that are known out there and maybe even creating some of your own. So, I'm trying to up your
21:17
game. um in in that which I've already kind of talked about. Um oh, Thursday
21:22
class time. So, a a little bit of a change from from last semester. Every
21:28
class that you attend and you have your camera on and you're engaged, you're going to get a 1% um you get one point
21:35
for the class. There are 14 classes. You have an opportunity to get 14%.
21:42
So, there's extra credit by attending class and participating. If you miss a class, this gives you an opportunity to
21:47
miss four classes, right? With no penalties, right? That's something that's that's new. But you
21:54
need to open your mouth. Um it's not me talking the whole time. I will literally
22:00
sit here and stare at you guys until you say something, right? Um the
22:07
reason why is because I expect you guys to come prepared to talk in class. There
22:13
are lectures that are out in GitHub uh that you can read. There will be videos
22:18
and audio um that you can listen to and I expect you guys to even uh crack open
22:25
your chat GBT or Claude or whatever LLM you want or do a Google search I don't
22:32
care but come to class ready to discuss uh what the lectures covered and the
22:39
concepts around them and even bring some world um experience into those. Uh so
22:45
the class schedule will be at the first 15 minutes I'll do a short lecture on one of the topics uh for the week
22:54
and then there's an hour of us discussing and I won't just have it us discussing the whole time. I'll I'll
23:00
have a couple activities that are breakout sessions, some question and answer type things and uh and but I
23:07
really want you guys to bring something to the table where we're learning, all of us are learning together, not just me
23:15
regurgitating a a bunch of slides because that's that's not fun for anyone um including
23:23
myself. Okay, any questions about that? Does that make sense?
23:29
All right, we're good. All right. Um, what we're going to cover, we're going to cover modern web um, programming
23:36
platforms. We're going to cover patterns for concurrency and parallel programming
23:42
in microser architectures. We're going to cover some of the development tools that are out there that help you with
23:47
this. Um, I will cover some um some Java Spring. It's an incredible platform if
23:54
you like working in the Java environment. But I will also cover nojs, go and rust as well and some of their
24:03
platforms um and the benefits of using them. Um we will also cover some
24:09
generative AI techniques and how to get the genai to and coersse the genai to
24:16
give you better responses and to interact with it in in a very productive
24:21
way. Um, some people in the past have had some hard times with Genai and have
24:29
trusted it implicitly and it's led them down the wrong path. So, u we're going to teach a lot about
24:37
how how to build up your um knowledge so that you can actually ask generative AI
24:44
important questions and that you can be critical in thinking on how those uh
24:51
responses are coming back. That's going to be um important. Okay.
24:57
um some of the key frameworks that we're going to be using. We're going to talk about streams, we're going to talk about
25:03
reactive streams and structured concurrency. Those are kind of the three big um design pattern uh groups that
25:10
we're going to talk about in in this course. Um you will be able to architect things that can handle millions of
25:18
messages um and in an effective way. And I'm talking millions of messages in minutes
25:26
um not in uh hours. So we're going to talk about some of those different architectural design patterns that can
25:32
handle that and how to scale up and scale down appropriately.
25:39
Um one of the one of the big modern web platforms out there is Spring Boot. Um I
25:46
will go over how it's architected and what the corlaries are in some other
25:51
languages but key um uh platforms that
25:56
we'll talk about is synchronous programming and asynchronous programming and the different uh types of um design
26:04
patterns we're going to see in them and also the benefits and the drawbacks to
26:09
each one. That's going to be very important when it comes to you designing and architecting your solution, right?
26:17
Based off of um you know the project that that you're going to uh work on. In
26:24
the past, we picked one project. Um I'm going to be more nice than that. I'm going to give you the option between
26:30
five different projects that you get to choose. I'm not going to be as bold as last class where you got to do whatever
26:37
you felt like. this one. I even I even have some starter data sets for you guys
26:42
um which will help out quite a bit, right? Um some of the pattern or or some
26:48
of the reasons why we want to use patterns um and we'll talk about how they interact with each other is
26:54
reusability. We know these work, why not use them? Maintainability. Uh these
26:59
patterns are well known and um easy to maintain, scalability, flexibility, and
27:05
then of course best practices. Um Doug Schmidt who taught this class before I started teaching it has written a great
27:12
book on design patterns. You can check out um that PDF uh that's that's right
27:17
there. I will send these slides out. They will be put up on Brightpace as well. So you guys can get access to
27:23
that. Uh Doug's a brilliant um software engineer. So u I I feel kind of uh
27:30
humbled to to take over his class like this uh because he left me with a lot of great stuff. So, uh, the development
27:37
environment will be using Git. You will hand your insight, uh, assignments into, um, GitHub or GitLab. I don't care which
27:44
one. I'll walk through how you submit assignments. Um, I use Intelligj. So,
27:50
you'll see a lot of the examples coming from Intelligj, but you can use any of the IDEs out there. Just make sure that
27:56
the IDE has some kind of code assistant in it that can read the repo that you're
28:02
currently in. This will help you because what happens is the code assistants are
28:08
really a generative AI. They're large language model that um use your repo as
28:13
a mini rag um which is retrieval augmented generation. So when you are
28:18
working through problems or coming up with your design and architecture, it will pull on the repo which has all the
28:25
lectures and all the notes to the lectures in there. So it'll make your lives a lot easier. Um I'm hoping.
28:31
Right. That's kind of the the idea behind it. Any questions on that so far?
28:40
No. Okay. Um, generative AI. Now, um,
28:45
this is a big this is a big thing for me. I actually, um, actually teach, uh, workshops on generative AI for
28:52
executives and also for, uh, common people, um, and for, um, also
28:58
professors. Um I I've taught at universities these uh one-day workshops
29:04
on generative AI. So I will be weaving some of that stuff that I teach in that workshop into the lectures and into our
29:11
discussions on Thursday. Some of the things that I've learned uh from working with um lots of organizations and and
29:18
lots of different techniques that are out there. One thing I want you guys all to realize, you cannot trust Gen AI
29:26
completely. And depending on which one you use, you can trust it even less.
29:33
Um, one of the reasons why is the algorithms are set up
29:39
um, specifically the public genis are set up to give you an answer
29:47
regardless of whether it knows the answer or not. It will give you an answer. So, it will make things up. And
29:54
if any of you have any kids, especially like five year olds and four year olds,
30:00
you know that's what they do, too. If they don't know something, they will make up an answer because they want to
30:06
please you. And that's about where we're at with Gen AI. It will rarely tell you
30:13
you're wrong. Um, it will rarely give an opinion unless you ask for it. So, we're
30:20
going to work through some different prompting techniques um to help us pull
30:25
out of the genai more information than we would normally get out of it to help
30:31
us make um uh design decisions and architectural decisions and then to help
30:37
us generate code uh effectively, right? Um that's one of the big differences
30:43
between vibe coding and what we're going to be uh working with u Philillip. So, I
30:48
hope that that helps. Um, like I mentioned earlier, all of the lectures,
30:55
even the transcript of today's um call, I will be putting into uh which is
31:02
different than last semester, I'll be putting into the repo. So, you'll be
31:08
getting the textbased transcripts of all this stuff. This will this will help if
31:13
you have questions on, hey, what went on in class last week? you'll have all that access to all that raw data and the LLM
31:22
can can uh find that information. Um, I do have a podcast. Um, if you want
31:28
to learn more about my philosophy around around this sort of stuff, uh, check out my podcast. That link is right there. I
31:35
do believe that link still works. If not, let me know and I'll I'll get you a new link. I just revamped the the
31:40
website. Um, and that might give you some insight into uh my philosophy around around this stuff.
31:48
and my philosophy changes. So, I'll just be honest with you. As I learn more things, I you know, I I'm I'm up for uh
31:55
making changes, right? Um the um oh,
32:02
I should remove the word Java out of here. The course is really broken into three major sections. Uh structured
32:09
concurrency and reactive systems. um synchronous and asynchronous web uh
32:15
communications and then software designing patterns, right? And you'll see that throughout the course and
32:21
you'll see it in the assignments as well. Okay? Um please make sure that you
32:27
review the modules um uh before class because we're going to discuss them in class. I'm not just going to lecture,
32:34
right? So, I expect you guys to come in ready to ask questions and and to debate
32:39
things together and to come up with great solutions together as as as a group.
32:45
Okay. Um, let's see. We went over some of this stuff.
32:52
Um, assessment philosophy. Here's another thing that might be new to some of you. There will not be written tests
32:59
in this class. There will be oral tests in this class. Uh there'll be a final.
33:06
Um it'll be an interview. It's like a job interview. It's it's not that painful obviously because three of my
33:13
previous students have come back. So I didn't scare them away too bad. But it's a half hour uh for the final
33:21
and we're doing a midterm uh a midterm uh um this year as well. So that will be
33:28
just you and I talking about what you learned so far this semester, talking about the projects that you're working
33:34
on and the direction you're headed. And we're going to have a discussion to talk
33:40
about um areas of improvement um where you think you could grow more
33:45
and and that's why we're doing the midterm, right? Um, so if you have a
33:50
hard time um with u oral exams, please let me know. Reach out to me and we'll
33:56
work something out. Um, I'm not that scary. I had uh one student last
34:02
semester was very worried about it, but we worked through it and and they they
34:07
did well in the class. So, um I have some techniques to help uh with that. Okay. One of the reasons why I got rid
34:14
of the written exams is frankly it's too tempting to use Gen AI to answer the
34:20
questions. So there's absolutely no way you can cheat in this class.
34:26
So you can try. You're not going to be able to, right? Because I've I've gotten rid of anything that let you cheat. Uh
34:33
so there there you go. All right. And so we're not doing anything written. Everything will be oral. Um, if you
34:39
think you're really good at deep fake video, um, I have a deep fake video
34:45
detector that we developed at Intel, so you won't get away with that one either.
34:50
So, I got you covered. Not a problem. Not a problem. Um, I do grade all of the um,
34:58
assessments, but I use I use Genai to grade it. I have a rubric. You guys will
35:04
see the rubric. I have some techniques that I use to grade your stuff. Um, this
35:10
semester we I am going to have a little um, uh, web client that I'll be hitting
35:17
your services with uh, to see how they perform. Um, so I'll be running that
35:22
against your stuff. Um, all your assignments will be handed in and I'll also need a Docker container uh, to to
35:29
run against. So we'll set that up. You'll see in in the first assignment how that's all going to work. Okay. So,
35:36
I'll be running a a simple client that will test your interfaces. Um, you'll
35:42
have all the data that you need uh uh to run it against. Um, so you should all be
35:48
in in good shape. Um, and I do use uh generative AI to run through all your
35:53
code, find problems and and grade it, right? So because I'm using Genai
36:01
um you get a very well as some of you have seen in the past it can be very
36:07
explicit on things that you can improve on. I expect you to learn from those things. Uh they're very good uh they're
36:14
very good at pointing out things specifically because of of the prompting
36:19
that I put in on the front end. Things I'm looking for specifically. Okay. assignments are due on Sundays, which is
36:27
horrible for me, by the way, but my students have have spoken and I have
36:33
listened. They're due Sunday at midnight on uh at midnight Tennessee time on the
36:39
day and and you'll you'll see in the in the assignments when they're due. Um there are five assignments. There are
36:46
four assignments in a final project, right? Um the first assignment is very
36:51
easy. It's setting up your environment and a baseline. It's just going to be can you uh set up a web service running
36:59
in a Docker container that I can attach to and I can do a health and I can I can
37:04
do one or two API calls to it, REST API calls. That's the first assignment. Um
37:11
that's a Z. A1 is um a little more than that. We're going to start um looking at
37:18
um uh implementing at least one service that deals with data. In that in that
37:25
one I'll be querying data. I'll be loading data and things like that. Then we'll move into integration and
37:30
persistence and resilience. Um I'm going to try and break your micros service. I have some really good
37:37
techniques to do that. Um especially since I'm getting your Docker containers. Then we're going to move on
37:42
to fully reactive and async pipelining and performance analysis. This is where
37:48
I'm going to throw several hundred clients. Um, and I have a whole server
37:54
farm behind me. I'm going to see how well your stuff uh can handle a bunch of clients just hammering your Docker
38:01
containers and your architecture. So, we'll do that. And then your capstone project is, hey, can we make this
38:08
production ready? Can we really make it resilient? Do I have observability? Can
38:14
I deploy a automatically deploy it? We'll be using um we can use Docker um
38:23
now I can't remember Docker Swarm. Thank you. We can use Docker Swarm for that
38:28
instead of going full-blown Kubernetes. Uh it's just a much easier platform to use. Um but if you guys want to use
38:35
Kubernetes, that's fine, too. So, those are those are kind of the details of the assignment. Um, there are five projects
38:42
to choose from that you get to choose. If you decide to switch projects partway
38:48
through, you're more than welcome to do that, but I think that just adds more time to what you need to do. Um, but the
38:56
projects are a movie and media recommener, an IoT smart home sensor platform. Trisha should love that
39:03
because she's already written one in the last class. um she'll just need to extend it a little bit. An online store,
39:10
shopping cart, a social news feed, and a food delivery and restaurant ordering system. So, those are the five projects.
39:17
You get to choose one of those projects you want to work work on. Um I do have a
39:22
bunch of synthetic data, both small, medium, and large. And I will be um
39:29
generating extra large uh for the final project which should have a million uh
39:35
data elements in it. That's what we're going after. Okay. I'm not providing you any starter code at all. Um that's
39:44
something you're going to have to learn how to do on your own. Uh and I've given you plenty of information on how to do
39:49
that. And Genai can generate a lot of that stuff for you. or you can pick whatever platform you wish to pick to do
39:56
that. This is where research from you guys is going to become important. You guys need to figure that out. Right?
40:03
This is where your architecture heads come in. Right? I I don't need to provide code for you that uh something
40:10
else can generate. Um this is how uh grading is going to happen. Um the first
40:16
four assignments are worth 10 points each uh which is 40. The final project's
40:22
worth 25. Uh the final exam, the interview will be worth 20%.
40:28
Um the weekly participation I already brought up is 10% but you have a you have a 4% kicker on that one if you
40:34
attend all the classes. And there will be a midterm as well um
40:40
which is worth five points. Right? This is a check-in with me. It's a half hour. I will um put together a calendar um
40:48
invite uh so that you guys um can um schedule that um starting next week.
40:55
You'll be able to schedule that'll be sometime in March, right? Um and I am doing a little bit of traveling but I
41:02
will be calling into these Thursday meetings no matter where in the world I am. Um and sometimes it might be in
41:09
India. In fact, I got a lot of travel. We almost had Trisha last semester in
41:15
New Zealand. We were all jealous, but she uh she didn't get
41:20
having me submit a visa for Australia, but everything's still pending. So,
41:26
work travel. Um I understand work travel because I have it too. Um that's why I gave a
41:32
little bit of slack, but I will dial in at three in the morning if I need to uh to be with you guys because I I think
41:39
we're going to have a lot of fun uh this semester. um submitting assignments. All the
41:44
assignments must be submitted through Brightpace and all I need is a link to
41:50
your um GitHub repo. That's all I need. Um I do it does need to be you do need
41:57
to put it in in time in Brightpace. The assignments are all in there already. Um
42:04
and I do check the time stamp on the repo. So don't just slide it in at at
42:09
midnight and then keep working on it past it because I will go to your time
42:14
stamp because I can do that in GitHub and whatever you checked in and committed before midnight is what I'm
42:20
going to take. Okay. Um I do tell people check in whatever you got. Even if it
42:28
fails, you're still going to get points, right? Um, another thing that I want to make sure that you guys do
42:35
is if you're having a conversation with a genai to help you make design
42:40
decisions, capture those, put those into your repo. Say, "Here's my conversation.
42:46
Here's how I made design decisions. I want to read that." That to me is more
42:52
important than the code that gets generated. Philip, go ahead. I was just going to say um to the point
42:58
of getting points for something that doesn't work, I believe last term I got
43:03
at least 90% on something that like didn't even fully run. So, um and you
43:09
probably remember this, but I was just going to say for for everyone else in the room, lest anyone not take that seriously, my my thing just like didn't
43:15
work because I did not provision resources properly or there was some something that was basically a total
43:21
showstopper. And I mean, yeah. So, I mean that that is like more true than you might think.
43:26
Yeah. And and because I I'm more concerned about are you guys learning the architectural
43:32
concepts and and the design principles more so than did your code compile? You
43:38
guys don't even compile code anymore. What am I talking about? Did your code work completely correctly? I'm more
43:44
concerned is the design pattern correct? We can work through the code issues later, right? and and eventually you
43:51
will have to, right? Um because we do need we do need the final project to actually run, right? Okay. Any qu I do
44:01
not take late assignments. There's no dog ate my homework. There's nothing like that. I just don't I just don't
44:07
have time to do late assignment uh regrading. Um especially since things
44:12
are handed in on a Sunday night. I used to have them handed in on a Friday, so I had all day Saturday to grade. Um but
44:20
not anymore. It's because I love my students so much. So um typically I have
44:26
the grading done within three or four days. Um okay.
44:32
Okay. Um key here, stay on top of the modules and the assignments. Don't get too far behind. There's a lot of
44:39
content. We're going to go through a lot, right? Um so also remember that the
44:45
assignments build on top of each other. um join any discussions in the Brightpace group. We didn't do a great
44:51
job on this last semester because I think our discussions on Thursdays kind of displaced a lot of that. But that is
44:58
a good place uh to uh share information is in Brightpace as well. If you do have
45:04
any questions, just send me an email. Um I I I tend to check the Vanderbilt email
45:10
every day, so at least once a day. So um I I I'll normally get back to you. You
45:16
can always reach out to me uh uh as well. Um I'll I'll give some other information where you guys can reach out
45:22
to me. Okay. Any questions from you guys?
45:30
No questions. The uh so I was I was looking at the the Brightpace uh the Brightpace site
45:36
and I'm not seeing any of the modules. Sorry if I missed that. They're they're
45:42
not they're not in there yet and you won't see a lot in the bright space.
45:48
Most of the modules you're going to see in the GitHub repo. Got it.
45:53
And so what I will put on the week on the weekly modules is I'll put um maybe
46:00
I should just I I'll go through and I'll put a link on those weekly modules to the to the modules in the GitHub repo.
46:07
That'll be the easiest way to do it. And the reason I do the GitHub repo is because I can add that as a LLM rag um
46:15
in your development environments. When things I can't really do much with them, right?
46:23
Um so I hope that helps, Tom. No, that that that uh that absolutely
46:29
does. And and then for the GitHub repo, where are we finding that? I'm gonna
46:37
send I'm gonna send out an email. Got it. Yep. I'll send out an email to the whole team with the link.
46:43
Um the um this this is week zero by the way. Week one, which starts next uh this
46:50
week. The lectures are up there. Um only one video is done uh so far. The other
46:55
videos will be coming um uh on Saturday more than likely. The videos are only
47:02
about 15 20 minutes tops. Um most of uh most of the information is in the
47:09
lecture notes and also in the PowerPoint presentation which is in an a markdown
47:14
language format. So they're easy to read, they're easy for an LLM to take
47:20
advantage of as well. So good questions. Any other questions?
47:29
All right. Uh Tom, I know you had to go grab your wife, try to get through that quickly. Um
47:36
thank you. Um so we do have a little bit more time and I do want you guys to share a little
47:44
bit. Um some of you guys know each other already, but some of you don't. So, just
47:51
give me a couple minutes on who you are and uh if you're working right now, if
47:57
you're a full-time student, what what you'd like to be called.
48:02
We've had I've we've had people who put their name down and they don't want to be called that. So, um let's start with
48:09
Eric. I already know Eric from my last class. So, Eric, go ahead and introduce yourself for everyone.
48:14
Sure. Hi everyone. I'm Eric Farber Agger. I work as a principal application developer for Vanderbilt University
48:20
Medical Center. Uh mostly in a EHR derived research. So I'm I'm in data all
48:26
the time. Haven't worked too much with microservices. So I'm excited to to learn a little bit more about this. Um
48:32
yeah, about me. I've got um two kids, four and two. I've got three cats. I
48:38
live in Nashville, Tennessee. Um and I've been doing programming for about 15
48:43
years now. So uh was excited to get back to school. Well, this will be my my last semester hopefully. Fingers crossed if I
48:49
can pass I pass this one. But uh last semester. Oh, okay. You got to pass this class.
48:56
Yeah. Yeah. It's in your hands. It's in my hands or mine, I guess I should say.
49:01
Effective. Yes. Um we had two students last semester that um graduated. So um so it is
49:08
doable. It is doable. Yeah. So yeah. Thanks, Eric. All right. Um, is it
49:14
Martina? Yeah, it's Martina. All right, Martina
49:19
Nik. Uh, most people don't get my last name right, but um, hi everyone. Um, I
49:25
was out for about a year um, out of school. I became a full-time mom. Um,
49:33
I'm Congratulations. Thank you. I'm a full-time software engineer. I work for a company called
49:38
Civic Eye. Um so we make software basically for um uh police officers, law
49:46
enforcement, um prosecutors um all over the country. Um a little bit
49:53
about me. Um I'm originally from Eastern Europe. Um I'm fluent in three human
49:59
languages. Um and I live in Chattanooga, Tennessee. So
50:05
wait, three human which human languages? So I'm fluent in German and I'm fluent
50:10
in Serbo Croatian and English and English. That's awesome. That is
50:16
awesome. So I'm guessing you're from that area from Serbia. I'm I'm a Bosnian Croat. Yeah.
50:23
Oh, that is awesome. That is awesome. So I like languages.
50:29
Well, great. All right. Uh Tom, you're up next if you're still there.
50:34
I am. I just tried to get off mute. Can you guys hear me? Yep. Yeah, we can. Yeah. And apologize. So, this will be
50:40
from the car, but uh so Tom Gaffffne um I guess I I
50:45
uh have worked for the last oh gosh uh getting close to 20 years now. Still not
50:50
quite, but uh in financial services. So, started uh well started my career in in
50:55
private equity, real estate, private equity, but that was in 2007. And if you guys may remember, it wasn't the best
51:00
time to be in real estate. Um after that kind of yeah shortly moved into uh a
51:06
commodities trading role. Um have sort of kept that over the last uh few years
51:11
kind of bouncing around to a couple of different firms. Spent the last 10 years at kind of a mid-size financial services
51:18
firm. Um but as part of that I guess maybe about 15 years ago I'm started to
51:23
get pretty interested into you know the different kind of financial modeling and things that we could build. you know, starting like, you know, I feel like a
51:29
lot of people do things like VBA is kind of a a gateway programming drug, uh, moving into kind of Python, R, um, you
51:37
know, over the years kind of took a series of courses through Stanford to kind of kind of bulk up some of my
51:44
computer science, uh, University of Washington, kind of same thing. And then, yeah, sort of took the opportunity
51:49
here at Vanderbilt to, uh, to really sort of formalize all that, uh, education into, uh, the M's program. So,
51:56
uh, working on a few projects at work right now that hopefully that or that this has already been really kind of,
52:01
uh, impactful in. We're we're building kind of an operational platform to manage our our physical commodity
52:07
trading. Uh, it's called the CTRM commodity trading and risk management system. Definitely uh, some of the ad
52:12
hoc modeling. So, yeah, I guess it's me in a nutshell. Um, born and raised in Alaska, kind of live in Seattle today,
52:19
live kind of all around the country. He went to school in Philadelphia, spent some time in DC, Houston, San Francisco.
52:26
Uh, and then one son who's uh about 12 days old. Um, so freshly minted.
52:34
That's awesome. Congratulations on that. All right, Trisha. Yeah, Trisha, you're up next.
52:41
Hello. I'm Trisha Brown. I'm currently a software engineer for Boeing on um the
52:47
vehicle training systems. Um, I've been working there for about 4 years. Uh, and
52:53
currently living in St. Louis, Missouri. Um, but I was born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt was
52:59
a big part of the family for me. I have a lot of family and friends that are alums. So, I figured if Boeing's paying
53:06
for me to get the degree, and the price tag not on me, I'm gonna do it. So, that's awesome, Trisha. And welcome
53:13
back. Uh, all right, Philip, your last but not least. Well, uh, I'm Philip
53:19
Ikeamp, uh, resident of Nashville, Tennessee. Um, in my final course, uh,
53:24
so along with Eric, I will be, uh, hopefully graduating at the end of this term. Uh, and, uh, and yeah, I, um, I do
53:32
basically like ID consulting, software design, basically whatever my, uh, firm,
53:37
uh, NT data has me doing on client work. Um, also in the very early stages of a
53:44
potential startup, but you know, uh, kind of like throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping it sticks, but we'll
53:50
see. Uh, and, uh, yeah. Um, I guess, uh,
53:55
I don't know how much else to say, what else is useful to say other than that, um, yeah, I was probably, uh, quite, uh,
54:04
relatively vivacious last term. So, we'll see if I, uh, have a repeat performance. I'm hoping so, Philip. You
54:10
always you always did a great job at questioning uh which is to me the best way to learn is that we talk together,
54:17
we learn together through um mutual experiences that that we have. So, I
54:23
appreciate that, Philip. All right, guys. Um you have any questions for me at all
54:31
besides why my phone is ringing off the hook? Philip knows why my phone's ringing off the hook. It is my birthday
54:36
today. So, and I do have 10 kids and they're all calling me. So,
54:44
I'm gonna be on the phone for the next couple hours uh after this class. So,
54:50
um but happy birthday. Well, thank you very much. Um so, um I
54:56
will I will post up on Brightpace the GitHub GitHub repo and also um I'll send
55:04
an email out to out to everyone. Um and uh we'll um also post the transcript of
55:10
this into the repo. You will see um updates to the repo every week as I am
55:16
going through and recording the lectures for uh for that week. Um I tried to say
55:22
I was going to do it over the Christmas break, but there is too much chaos going on over here um at my house when um
55:29
several of the kids came home. um which the house kind of shutters when they all
55:34
start rolling home with their with their kids. So um
55:39
I understand uh work life balance that it is out of balance especially when you're in school. I got my PhD while I
55:46
was working full-time and had uh during COVID when seven of my ten kids came
55:54
back home during COVID um and we'd already gotten rid of most of them. So
55:59
it was it was a crazy time. So So I understand a working professional
56:05
working professional students um um and hopefully this course uh will give you
56:11
enough time to use some things in your own jobs as well as um get some value
56:18
out of it um for for your careers long term. All right guys, that's all I got uh for
56:24
today. Um, next week you'll only get 15 minutes out of me and the rest is you
56:30
guys. So, we're gonna have a lot of fun next uh next week. So, take a look at
56:35
those lectures. Like I said, um the uh the text is already up there. An email
56:41
will go out and the rest of the uh the videos will be up uh by Saturday.
56:49
Okay. All right, guys. Thank you so much and I look forward to a great uh a great
56:56
semester. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you and happy birthday. Bye. Thanks. Bye.
